# Front-end features

## Graph manipulation

![Node palette](img/node-palette.png)

On the left side there is a node palette (which can be turned off or on using the green icon in the upper left corner).
To add a new node to the graph, click the node in the palette and drag it to the editor.
You can also select existing nodes and copy and paste them using `ctrl-c` and `ctrl-v` keyboard shortcuts.

After loading a specification, the palette will contain all the nodes defined in it and will be divided into hierarchical categories.
Additionally, a graph node named `New Graph Node` is always available under a `Graphs` category and can be used to design custom graphs.

![Node context menu](img/node-context-menu.png)

In the upper right corner of each node there is a context menu toggle. It contains the following options:
* `Rename` - Changes instanceName of the node. More details regarding node naming can be found in the ['instanceName' field of dataflow format](project:dataflow-format.md#node)
* `Delete` - Deletes the node from the dataflow. Another way of deleting nodes is to select and press the `Delete` key.
* Additional, user defined URLs. More details in the [URL specification](project:specification-format.md#url-class)

Scroll lets you to zoom in and out.
Left-clicking and dragging the editor background allows you to move around the editor area.

Left-clicking on a node allows you to select and drag the node within the editor area. Pressing the `ctrl` key while moving a node allows you to align the node with another one along some axis.

To create a connection, left-click a node's connector and connect it to a connector (of a matching type, see [Specification format](specification-format)) on another node.
Double left-click on an existing connection removes it.

## Settings

![Settings tab](img/settings-tab.png)

On the upper right corner of {{project}} window there is a gear icon toggling settings tab. In the tab the following options can be found:
* `Connection style` - Switch the style of the connection between `orthogonal` and `curved`
* `AutoLayout algorithm` - Choose the algorithm for automatic node placement. Autolayout algorithm is triggered in the following situations:
  * When loading the dataflow autolayout is used to place nodes without the `position` parameter set. Dataflow load can be triggered either via external application or
  choosing the `Load graph file` option. In this case autolayout is applied to both the main graph and the nodes in the subgraphs.
  * By pressing the `Apply autolayout` button in the settings tab. In this case autolayout is applied to the entire graph.
* `Background grid size` - Sets the size of single grid cell visible in the background
* `Node movement step` - Sets the minimum step size which can be taken along each axis when moving node.
* `Center` - Pressing this buttons moves the viewport to the center of graph and sets the zoom level so that whole dataflow is visible
* `Hide layers` - [Metadata](project:specification-format.md#layer) allows to specify layers for a certain set of interface types and connections. Toggling this checkbox allows to hide
connections belonging to said layer
* `Modify node types` - Toggling this checkbox allows adding new node types to the specification

## Notifications

![Notifications](img/notifications.png)

{{project}} provides notifications describing errors occurring in:

* The front end, such as invalid input specification, or invalid dataflow
* The back end (see [Communication with an external application](external-app-communication))

During pipeline development or execution, notifications can display various messages to the user.

## Full screen

![Full screen button](img/fullscreen.png)

Near the settings tab, there is a full screen icon. Clicking it will expand the {{project}} window to full screen.
Note that this feature may be disabled during embedding {{project}} in an external application, make sure to allow full screen mode.

For example, in the case of embedding {{project}} in an iframe, the `allow="fullscreen"` attribute must be set:
```html
<iframe src="https://url" allow="fullscreen">
  <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>
</iframe>
```

## Editor menu

![Front end menu](img/frontend-menu.png)

Depending the application's mode (`static-html` or `server-app`), the following options will be available in the {{project}} menu:

* `Load specification` - lets the user load a specification file describing the nodes that can appear in the graph (see [Specification format](specification-format))
  ```{note}
  It appears only in the `static-html` build mode, where a specification is not delivered by a third-party app.
  ```
* `Load graph file` - lets the user load a graph specification in {{project}}'s internal format (see [Dataflow specification](dataflow-format)).
* `Save graph file` - Saves the graph currently stored in the editor into JSON using {{project}}'s internal format.
* `Export graph to PNG` - Saves the graph currently stored in the editor as PNG image
* `Load file` - lets the user load a file describing a graph in the native format supported by the third-party application using {{project}} for visualization.
  ```{note}
  It appears only in the `server-app` build mode, since the third-party app performs conversion from its native format to the [Dataflow format](dataflow-format)
  ```
* `Save file` - saves the current graph in a native format supported by the third-party application using {{project}} for visualization.
  ```{note}
  It appears only in the `server-app` build mode, since the third-party app performs conversion from the [Dataflow format](dataflow-format) received from the editor to its native format.
  ```

## Creating new node types

After toggling the `Modify nodes types` checkbox in settings, the option `Create new node type` becomes available in the editor menu.

Selecting it displays the `Node configuration menu`.

![Node configuration menu](img/node-configuration-menu.png)

After the node is created, it will be visible in the node palette.

The node type can be configured further from the editor, e.g. by adding properties and interfaces.

To add the new node type to the current specification, choose the `Finalize` option in the node menu.

## Working with the server

When {{project}} works in the `server-app` mode, it is connected to an external application, making it possible to manipulate or execute a graph as well as save and load files in the application's native format.

![Server status](img/frontend-server-status.png)

Status of the connection is displayed in the upper right corner of the editor.
The color of the icon indicates the status of the connection with the server:

* `Red` - No connection with the server.
* `Green` - Connection with the server is established.

Extrnal application may deliver additional features by providing additional buttons in the editor menu.
More details can be found in the [Specification format](project:specification-format.md#navbar-item) section.

## URL parameters for the frontend

The frontend of Pipeline Manager provides a set of URL parameters that can be used to change the specification, graph or default behavior of the application.
Those arguments need to be encoded - we need to escape all URL-specific characters.
This can be achieved either with `urllib.parse.urlencode` in Python:

```python
import urllib.parse

urllib.parse.urlencode({
    "spec": "https://github.com/antmicro/kenning-pipeline-manager/blob/main/examples/sample-specification.json",
    "graph": "https://github.com/antmicro/kenning-pipeline-manager/blob/main/examples/sample-dataflow.json"
})

# RESULT: 'spec=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fantmicro%2Fkenning-pipeline-manager%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Fsample-specification.json&graph=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fantmicro%2Fkenning-pipeline-manager%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Fsample-dataflow.json'
```

or with `encodeURIComponent` in Javascript:

```javascript
encodeURIComponent("https://github.com/antmicro/kenning-pipeline-manager/blob/main/examples/sample-specification.json")

// RESULT: 'https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fantmicro%2Fkenning-pipeline-manager%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Fsample-specification.json'
```

Available parameters are as follows:

* `spec` - URL to the specification, by default it can be a HTTP/HTTPS URL.
* `graph` - URL to the graph, by default it can be a HTTP/HTTPS URL.
* `preview` - starts Pipeline Manager in read only mode, without HUD
* `include` - allows to provide includes for the specification.

When it comes to `spec` and `graph`, by default we can use following URI schemes:

* `http://`, `https://`
* `relative://` - picks a path relative to the Pipeline Manager URL
* `data:application,` or `data:application;base64,` - JSON embedded as [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data)

To add more URI schemes, we need to define `VUE_APP_JSON_URL_SUBSTITUTES` variable holding a dictionary mapping scheme name to appropriate template/prefix.

The JSON for URL substitutes can look as follows:

```json
{
    "examples": "https://github.com/antmicro/kenning-pipeline-manager/examples/{}"
}
```

And be later be referred to as `examples://sample-specification.json` in URL.

```{note}
The URI schemes can be passed to `pipeline_manager build` via `--json_url_specification` argument.
```

## Passing JSON objects directly

There is also a possibility to pass JSON objects directly to the frontend, without having to save them to a file and add to URL.

This can be done by sending [POST requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) from an external app opening Pipeline Manager, e.g:

```javascript
const iframe = document.getElementById(pipelineManagerIframe);
iframe.contentWindow.postMessage({ specification, dataflow }, pipelineManagerURL);
```

This piece of code opens Pipeline Manager in an iframe and provides it with a `data` JSON object containing the requested specification.

The window accepts a specification, or a dataflow, or both.

Note that this method still supports URLs.

## Testing the front-end features

The best way to test the front-end features is to use the `pipeline_manager.frontend_tester.tester_client`, [Third-party server example](example-server).
